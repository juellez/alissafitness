# alissafitness

Check out the site in development at http://juellez.github.io/alissafitness -- it's only a work in progress at this point and not meant to be indicative of any final design or functionality.

It is powered by the `gh-pages` branch. I've left the `master` branch as the default branch, as I'm not sure yet where the site will be hosted. If it'll be hosted off of github, `master` will be the master branch for release, leaving `gh-pages` free for staging and previewing updates.

We can create development branches as necessary and I'll do my best to summarize design conversations and outstanding work & reviews needed in tickets.
